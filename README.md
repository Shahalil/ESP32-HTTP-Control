# ESP32-HTTP-Control
## ESP32 project for remote control using HTTP requests.

Task: Use HTTP requests in ESP32 code to get data from a database.

As part of my summer training, I am required to implement and test HTTP requests in my ESP32 code to interact with a database. This task involves connecting the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network and periodically sending HTTP GET requests to a specified URL to retrieve and handle data. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the process:

1. Wi-Fi Connection: The ESP connects to the Wi-Fi network using the provided `ssid` and `pass`.
2. Serial Communication: It initializes serial communication to display the status and IP address once connected.
3. HTTP Requests: In the `loop()`, every 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds), the ESP sends an HTTP GET request to the URL "https://s-m.com.sa/f.html".
4. Response Handling: The code checks the response code; if successful, it prints the server's response to the Serial Monitor; otherwise, it prints an error message.
5. Purpose: The goal is to control the ESP remotely via the internet by sending different commands through HTTP requests. I can experiment with the URL by changing the last letter according to my needs:
   - Use "f.html" for the "forward" command.
   - Use "b.html" for the "backward" command.
   - Use "s.html" for the "stop" command.
   - Use "l.html" for the "left" command.
   - Use "r.html" for the "right" command.
